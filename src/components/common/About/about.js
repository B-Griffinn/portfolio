        <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer based out of San Francisco, CA. I
            enjoy solving hard problems and making people's lives easier through
            technology. When I'm not coding, you'll find me cooking, reading or
            exercising.</p>
        <p>
        I design and code beautifully simple things, and I love what I do.
