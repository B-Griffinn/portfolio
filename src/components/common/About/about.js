        <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>


        <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion in improving lives   through the power of technology.
        I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns — from delivering pizza and bussing tables, a senior technology analysit at the largest U.S. mobile bidding company, project manager of an education technology start up, to small business owner and entrepreneur — I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a positive impact on your business.
